Originally inspired by the black face Impactâ„¢, it soon evolved to include numerous weights from the Black flavor of its progenitor to a super thin Pinstripe.
</p>
<p>  
The extreme weights (Pinstripe, Hairline and Black) are designed for display situations while the remaining weights may be used for more traditional textual design applications. The Inline and Collegiate flavors offer added display options.
</p>
<p>
Alumni is available in roman and italic versions of each weight. Extensive kerning and OpenType programming have been applied to give it optimal functionality.
</p>
<p>
It comes with Latin Character sets including Western, Central, and Vietnamese language support.
